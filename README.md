# Password Generator Application

This application generates a password based on user input.

This Project Password Generator is built purely using JavaScript. I have created this using the knowledge i got during the classes and also some research.

I have used Promt, Confirm and Alert functions to get the user input and functions to generate the password.

In order to generate a random password every time I have used the function called Math.Random and also I have used If statments for make sure the user inputs valid answers and generates a password.
